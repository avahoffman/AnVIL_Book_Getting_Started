Workspaces enable you to organize your **data**, **compute environments** and **documentation**, and **share** your projects with other users.

This video gives a quick tour of a Workspace, showing how the data, interactive notebooks, and workflows are organized.

Workspaces can be used to...

- **Organize data, analysis pipelines, and compute environments, e.g.**
    - A specific research project
- **Share data and workflows, e.g.**
    - A common set of data and/or workflows that members can copy over to use in their own Workspaces
    - A gold-standard analysis or tutorial for members to learn from or replicate
- **Manage controlled access to data**
    - Workspaces can have "**Authorization Domains**", which automatically prevent the Workspace from being shared with non-authorized users.  Note that Authorization Domains cannot be changed after a Workspace is created (but users can be added to or removed from an Authorization Domain).
