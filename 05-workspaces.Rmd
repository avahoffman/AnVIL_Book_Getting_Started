# Workspaces

Workspaces are the building blocks of projects in Terra. Inside a Workspace, you can run analyses, launch interactive tools like RStudio and Galaxy, store data, and share results. The video below gives a brief introduction to the parts of a Workspace.

## Create a New Workspace

```{r, child=c("_child_create_workspace.Rmd")}

```

## Clone an Existing Workspace

<!-- Remind that data in tables is linked back to original data/Workspace -->

```{r, child=c("_child_clone_workspace.Rmd")}

```
